# Emotion Detection Using Facial Expression

## Introduction

This repository contains code for a facial expression recognition system that detects emotions from images or video streams. The system utilizes computer vision and deep learning techniques to analyze facial expressions and predict the corresponding emotions.

## Installation

To use this system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-detection.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the pre-trained model weights (if not included in the repository) and place them in the appropriate directory.

## Usage

### Training

If you want to train your own model:

1. Prepare your dataset. Ensure that your dataset is organized with images of faces and corresponding emotion labels.

2. Train the model using the provided scripts. Adjust hyperparameters as needed.

    ```
    python train.py --data_path path/to/your/dataset --epochs 20
    ```

3. Once training is complete, evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune it as necessary.

### Inference

To use the trained model for inference:

1. Provide the path to the image or video containing faces.

2. Run the inference script:

    ```
    python predict.py --input_path path/to/image/or/video
    ```

The system will output the predicted emotions for each face detected in the image or video.

## Model Architecture

The system uses a deep learning architecture, typically a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a combination of CNN and recurrent neural network (RNN), to extract features from facial images. These features are then passed through fully connected layers for emotion prediction.

## Dataset

The performance of the emotion detection system heavily depends on the quality and diversity of the dataset used for training. Commonly used datasets for emotion detection include FER2013, CK+, and AffectNet.
